### Hi there 🤗

My name is Laura and I'm a software engineer from Spain, **currently working fully remote from Germany** 🚀

After studying Psychology 🧠 I found another passion in **software development** 💻 and decided to pursue my career in this field 🤸‍♀️

💪 I have now **more than 6 years of professional experience as a software engineer** in B2B SaaS companies within international and agile working environments, in multiple cross-functional teams where **product-engineering collaboration** was paramount.

🙋‍♀️ At a more personal level, even though my ID card says I was born in Madrid, I'm [segoviana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia) to the bone. I like writing and photography 📷 which you can currently check out in [my Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lauus64/), but I will be hosting my creative work on a personal site soon 🙂. I would love to live where the mountains meet the sea 🗻🌊 with at least three cats 🐈 and a garden to grow my own vegetables 🍓

🌱 Currently learning Python 🐍 and deepening my accessibility knowledge 

👩‍💻 My latest project: ✨ Tinybnb ✨ ([published site](https://sayheylaura.github.io/tinybnb/) | [repo](https://github.com/sayheylaura/tinybnb))

🤖 **How I use AI**

I do think AI is _just another tool_, it doesn't replace my skills and knowledge, but it can speed up development if you use it wisely. These are two really well-written posts by Den Delimarsky that illustrate exactly the way I feel about this topic: [Agents Are Your Mech Suit](https://den.dev/blog/agents/) and [You Need To Become A Full Stack Person](https://den.dev/blog/full-stack-person/).

I'm learning how to do proper context engineering to be more efficient and avoid wasting unnecessary resources. Data privacy is also a big topic for me both in my personal and professional lives, so I'm very careful about the way I prompt AI agents.

In the past few months I've been using [Cursor](https://cursor.com/). I mainly use Cursor's agent for:

- Refactoring code to avoid repetitive tasks
- Implementing tests
- Implementing solutions that I'm unsure of, in a step-by-step way, asking questions to learn, and questioning the generated code when I know something's off or missing

In the past, I also used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for more general questions that are not so related to the project I'm working on, or when I need to plan a bigger task and I'm unsure about the steps to follow. This is helping me learn in a much better and efficient way than just googling. Lately I've switched to [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for this purpose.
